def longest_substring(s: str) -> int:
    """
    Find length of longest substring without repeating characters using sliding window.
    Uses a dictionary to track last seen positions of characters and adjusts window size.

    Args:
        s: Input string to analyze

    Returns:
        int: Length of longest substring without repeating characters

    Time Complexity: O(n) where n is length of string
    Space Complexity: O(min(m,n)) where m is size of character set

    Example:
        >>> longest_substring("abcabcbb")
        3  # Longest substring is "abc"
