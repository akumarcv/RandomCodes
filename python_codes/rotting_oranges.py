def rotting_oranges(grid):
    """
    Calculates the minimum time to rot all fresh oranges.
    
    This function uses a breadth-first search (BFS) approach to simulate 
    the rotting process. Each minute, all the rotten oranges will spread 
    the rot to adjacent (up, down, left, right) fresh oranges.
    
    Parameters:
    -----------
    grid : List[List[int]]
        A grid where:
        - 0 represents an empty cell
        - 1 represents a fresh orange
        - 2 represents a rotten orange
    
    Returns:
    --------
    int
        The minimum number of minutes needed for all oranges to rot,
        or -1 if it's impossible to rot all oranges
    
    Time Complexity: O(m*n) where m and n are the dimensions of the grid
    Space Complexity: O(m*n) in the worst case for the queue
