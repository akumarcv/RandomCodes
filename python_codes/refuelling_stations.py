def min_refuel_stops(target, start_fuel, stations):
    """
    Find minimum number of refueling stops to reach target distance.
    Uses greedy approach with max heap to select optimal refueling stations.

    Args:
        target: Target distance to reach
        start_fuel: Initial fuel amount in the vehicle
        stations: List of [position, fuel] pairs representing refueling stations

    Returns:
        int: Minimum number of stops needed to reach target
        0: If target can be reached without refueling
        -1: If target cannot be reached regardless of stops

    Time Complexity: O(n log n) where n is number of stations
    Space Complexity: O(n) for the max heap storage

    Example:
        >>> min_refuel_stops(15, 3, [[2, 5], [3, 1], [6, 3], [12, 6]])
        2  # Need to refuel at stations with position 2 and 6
